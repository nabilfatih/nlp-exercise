# H 4.2 Semantic Parsing

## Integrating Semantic Analysis Using Lambda Calculus into a Parser

### 1. Storing Information in Grammar Rules

To integrate semantic analysis into a parser using lambda calculus, we need to store additional semantic information alongside the syntactic rules in the grammar:

- **In the Grammar File:** We can extend the grammar rules to include semantic rules. This is often done by associating lambda expressions with grammar symbols. For example, a grammar rule in a file might look like this:

  ```txt
  NP -> Det Noun {λx. Det(x) ∧ Noun(x)}
  ```

  In this rule, `Det` and `Noun` are syntactic categories, and `{λx. Det(x) ∧ Noun(x)}` is the lambda calculus expression that represents the semantic information.

- **In Object Representations at Runtime:** During parsing, each grammar rule can be represented as an object that includes fields for both the syntactic pattern and the semantic function. For instance, in Python, we might define a class for grammar rules where each instance has properties for the syntax and the semantics:

  ```python
  class GrammarRule:
      def __init__(self, syntax, semantics):
          self.syntax = syntax
          self.semantics = semantics
  ```

### 2. Example Grammar with Semantic Parsing

The sketch of a simple grammar that can parse the sentence "Noah likes expensive restaurants" and provide a meaning for it:

- **Grammar Rules in the File:**

  ```txt
  #ABNF V1.0 utf-8;
  language en;
  public $S = $NP $VP {foreach x (JJ(x) && NNS(x)) -> Likes(Noah, x)};
  $NP = $NNP {lambda x = NNP(x)};
  $NNP = Noah {lambda x = 'Noah'};
  $VP = $VBZ $NP {lambda y = foreach (VBZ(y) && NP(x)) -> Likes(y, x)};
  $VBZ = likes {lambda f, y = foreach x (f(x)) -> Likes(y, x)};
  $NP = $JJ $NNS {lambda x = JJ(x) && NNS(x)};
  $JJ = expensive {lambda x = JJ(x)};
  $NNS = restaurants {lambda x = NNS(x)};
  ```

- **Parsing the Sentence "Noah likes expensive restaurants":** The semantic representation would be a lambda expression that describes the action of sleeping performed by the cat.

### 3. Representing Lambda Expressions in Python

- **Storage Representation:** In Python, lambda expressions can be represented as strings or as actual lambda functions. For more complex expressions, we might use a library like `SymPy` which can handle symbolic mathematics.

- **Conversion Mechanism:** To convert the text-based lambda expressions from the grammar file into executable Python code, we can use the `eval` function cautiously or better, write a custom parser for these expressions to safely convert them into Python functions.

  ```python
  def convert_to_lambda(expression):
      # A simple conversion; in practice, we would add error handling and security checks
      return eval(expression)
  ```

### 4. Adapting the Parser for Semantic Parsing

To support semantic parsing, the parser needs to:

- **Parse the Syntax and Semantics Together:** As the parser processes each rule, it should also compute the semantics by applying the semantic functions associated with the rules.

- **Combine Semantic Functions:** When rules are combined (e.g., an NP and a VP to form an S), their associated semantic functions must also be combined according to the lambda calculus expressions provided in the rules.

- **Return Semantic Representations:** Instead of just confirming whether a sentence is grammatically correct, the parser should also return the semantic representation of the sentence.
