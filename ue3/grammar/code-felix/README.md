# Note

- `parser.py` is renamed to `my_parser.py`
- The `is_CNF()` is not to complicated and should be self explanatory
- Since i struggled to implement the CKY algorithm my idea was to provide detailed visualization.
  - `make_table()` inits the CKY table with slight differences for parser and is_in_language
  - Jupyter notebook contains all results as well as visualizations and images from [https://mshang.ca/syntree/](https://mshang.ca/syntree/)
